# INTERVAL RNA seq eQTL analysis
This is a repository of scripts used in the analysis of the RNA seq data from the INTERVAL cohort. Currently this is a work in progress, but this README will be updated as the analysis progresses.

## Current state of analysis
Batches 1-3 of seq data have been downloaded from the Sanger server with globus.
Phenotype data has been requested for the whole cohort from the data management team. This is currently mapped to batches 1 & 2 (see [the appropriate R script](make_id_mapper_file.R)
